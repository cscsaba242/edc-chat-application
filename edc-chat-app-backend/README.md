# Chat Application backend

## About The Project

This is the backend implementation for chat application through EDC. The server connects to the below entities for a
successful chat flow:

- a Business Partner's EDC to establish a two-way communication.
- a Postgres database to store other Business Partners' information and chat history.
- a simple UI to send messages to and receive messages from other Business Partners.

**NOTE:** When the backend application starts, it will create the Asset, Policy, and Contract Definition. However, if
the assetId as an **edc-chat-app** is already in the edc database, itâ€™ll skip this process.

## Packages Overview

The backend application consists of the below packages:

- **dao:** Contains the database entities and their JPA repositories
- **edc:** This package contains a client to communicate with another EDC, services to create assets, policies,
  negotiate contract,data transfer etc.
- **service:** Houses the services that implement the application's business logic
- **utils:** The utils package contains application configurations, constants, validation methods, etc.
- **web:** Houses the main application and the REST controllers for communicating with the server
    - **apidocs:** This child package contains the documentation of the APIs in the web package and is used in
      generating the OpenAPI specification

## WebSocket

This application uses WebSocket connection to facilitate simultaneous transfer of messages between frontend and the
server. The [WebSocketConfig.java](src/main/java/com/smartsense/chat/config/WebSocketConfig.java) implements
`WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer` interface to configure below properties:

- **STOMP Endpoint:** This endpoint is added to the `StompEndpointRegistry` for the clients to look up and connect to
  the WebSocket.
- **Message Broker destinations:** The client subscribes to these prefixes for receiving messages from the server.
- **Application Destination Prefixes:** The client sends messages to the server using these API prefixes.
- **User Destination Prefix:** This prefix is used while establishing a unique session between the client and the
  server.

## How to deploy the backend application :

### Pre-requisite to start backend Application

- EDC
- Wallet Stub
- Postgres Database

### Local setup :

- Build the Project
  Open the project terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew clean build
- For locally deploy EDC, Postgres, wallet using Docker, please refer : [README.md](deployment/README.md)
- After deployment, set the following environment variables:

## Database

For data migration, we use Liquibase. So when the application starts or restarts, the data will already be added or
updated.
